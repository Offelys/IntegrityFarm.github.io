          <h2><strong>Process of Saving Genetic Information into Blockchain</strong></h2>
          <p></p>
          <h2><strong>1.Data Collection</strong></h2><p>Collecting genomic data involves obtaining DNA samples from individuals, typically through saliva or blood samples. These samples are then processed in a laboratory to extract the DNA and sequence the genome. The resulting data is a digital representation of the individual's genetic code. It's like embarking on a genetic treasure hunt to uncover the secrets of DNA! 🧬🔍</p>
          <h2><strong>2.Data Comparison</strong></h2><p>The collected genomic data is compared against a standard reference genome, like detectives comparing clues to uncover unique genetic variations. These variations, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic markers, hold the key to understanding each individual's genetic uniqueness. By focusing on these differences, we can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored. It's like finding the genetic needle in a haystack! 🧬🔍</p>
          <h2><strong>3.Data Encryption</strong></h2><p>To ensure the utmost privacy for these genetic secrets, the identified genetic differences are encrypted using advanced encryption algorithms. This encryption transforms the data into a secure format that can only be accessed by authorized individuals with the correct decryption key. It's like locking these genetic treasures in a digital vault! 🔒🔬</p>
          <h2><strong>4.
